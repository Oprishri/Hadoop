# Hadoop Practicals

- Hadoop is a framework for distributed storage and processing.
- Core components of Hadoop include HDFS for storage, YARN for cluster-resource
management, and MapReduce or Spark for processing.
-The Hadoop ecosystem includes multiple components that support each stage of
big data processing:

    - Flume and Scoop ingest data
    - HDFS and HBase store data
    - Spark and MapReduce process data
    - Pig, Hive, and Impala analyze data
    - Hue and Search help to explore data
    - Oozie manages the workflow of Hadoop tasks
